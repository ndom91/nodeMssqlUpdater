# Node Goliath Updater

Small program to Update all Goliath country entries from German to English

## Instructions 

First create your own copy of `.env.template` and name it `.env`. This is where you fill it out with your connection details. 

Then simply execute `index.js` with node, for example: `node index.js`

> Of course you can adjust the DB query in `index.js` to loop over any other table and make any other changes to the Goliath DB with this little program.
